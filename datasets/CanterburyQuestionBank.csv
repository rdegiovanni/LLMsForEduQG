634156,easy,What design stategy does Quicksort use?,Divide and conquer,Greedy,Dynamic programming,Brute force,Quicksort is a divide and conquer design strategy.
634959,easy,Which abstract datatypes would be the best choice to determine whether the parentheses in a program are balanced?,Stack,Queue,List,Dictionary,"A close parenthesis must match the most recently entered open parenthesis. So for example, the sequence )()( doesn't match, while ()() and (()) do, even though they all have two open and two close parentheses. To make this work, you can push each open parenthesis on a Stack, and pop it off each time you see a close parenthesis. The last-in-first-out nature of a Stack makes it easy to determine whether the parentheses are balanced."
634145,easy,Prim's Algorithm is used to solve what problem?,Minimum spanning tree,Finding the lowest parent of a heap,Shortest path in a graph from a source,Sorting integers,Prim's is used for implementing the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) search algorithm.
630945,hard,Which abstract datatypes would be the best choice to implement the back button on a Web browser?,Stack,Queue,List,Dictionary,"When you click on the back button, you should see the last page you visited, so the datatype that stores the previously visited webpages must be last-in-first-out. Stack is a last-in-first-out abstract datatype."
630947,easy,Which abstract datatypes would be the best choice to implement a program modeling the arrival of patients to an emergency room in a hospital?,PriorityQueue,Stack,List,Dictionary,"In an emergency room, you want to serve patients in the order of how urgent their condition is, and if two patients have equally urgent conditions, in the order that they arrived. A PriorityQueue is an abstract datatype that meets both of these conditions."
633260,hard,When is an adjacency matrix a good choice for implementing a graph?,When the graph is nearly complete.,When the graph is undirected.,When a graph has few edges.,When the graph contains no cycles.,"The adjacency matrix compactly and efficiently stores edges when it contains little wasted space. In a complete graph, each vertex shares an edge with each other vertex, meaning all elements in the adjacency matrix are been used."
633259,hard,When is an adjacency list a good choice for implementing a graph?,When a graph has few edges.,When the graph is undirected.,When the graph is nearly complete.,When the graph contains no cycles.,"In adjacency lists graph representation, each vertex stores its own list of vertices it's connected to. When a graph contains few edges, these lists are very short and likely consume less memory than the adjacency matrix."
634971,hard,What is can be modeled with an interface in Java?,Unrelated classes that share particular capabilitieUnrelated classes that share particular capabilities,Abstract classes,Related classes that share particular attributes,Classes that communicate using the same network protocol,"Interfaces allow us to specify common capabilities in unrelated classes: a way to say that two classes have the same methods without specifying the implementation (and allowing completely different implementations). For closely related classes (near each other in inheritance hierarchy) we can get common capabilities by having them in a common ancestor. Abstract classes provide a method to specify common capabilities via inheritance.  Interfaces cannot be used to specify that two classes share a set of attributes (i.e. instance variables), which can be done by having classes inherit from a common ancestor with those attributes."
633554,hard,What terminates a failed linear probe in a full hashtable?,Revisiting the original hash index,The end of the array,A deleted node,A null entry,"A null entry will not appear in a full hashtable. Seeing the end of the array isn't correct, since we need to examine all elements, including those that appear before our original hash index. A node with a non-matching key is what started our probe in the first place. The purpose of leaving a deleted node in the table is so that probing may proceed past it. Revisiting the original hash index means we've looked at every entry and determined the item doesn't appear in the table."
634189,hard,What is not a property of a max-heap?,Its values are sorted in when printed in level order,It is complete,A node’s value is less than or equal to that of its parent,Its root is the maximum element in the tree,A max-heap need not be sorted.
633561,easy, What data structure is used to implement a depth-first search?,stack,queue,hashtable,LinkedList,"As you visit nodes, if you push their neighbors on a stack, the neighbors will be the first popped off when you need to backtrack. This behavior is what makes a depth-first search depth-first."
632571,easy,What is the worst-case time complexity of radix sort?,O(k n),O(1),O(n),O(n2),"n is the number of items to be sorted, as usual, and k is the number of digits in the largest number in the list. Radix sort processes the entire list (n numbers) once for each of the k digits in the largest number in the list, so the work done is proportional to n*k. "

By definition, the element removed from a stack is always the one that was added most recently, or the one at the ""top."""
632315,easy,What does the dequeue operation do?,removes and returns the item at the front of a queue, adds a new item at the front of a queue,returns without removing the item at the front of a queue,adds a new item at the end of a queue,"dequeue is the name for the operation that removes an element from a queue. Specifically, it removes the item that was added *first* (just as the first person in a line gets served first). "
631460,easy,"In Java, what is not considered to be part of the signature of a method?",Return type,Method name,Number of parameters,Types and order of parameters,"In Java the return type is not considered as part of the signature.  Why should I care?  If i want to use method overloading (have different methods with the same name) the methods must have unique signatures, and so i cannot have 2 methods with the same name that have the same number, type, and order of parameters that differ on return type."
634979,easy,What is a NP-Complete problem?,"solvable, and the best known solution is not feasible (i.e. runs in exponential time)","solvable, and the best known solution runs in polynomial time (i.e. feasible)","currently unsolvable, but researchers are hoping to find a solution.",provably unsolvable: it has been shown that this problem has no algorithmic solution.,NP-Complete problems typically have rather simplistic algorithmic solutions.  The problem is that these solutions require exponential time to run.  
633262,hard,What advantage does using dummy nodes in a linked list implementation offer?,Simplified insertion,Reduced storage needs,Easier detection of the list's head and tail,Simplified iteration,"Dummy nodes consume a little more space, and they don't simplify iteration or bounds detection any. They do reduce the special casing that would otherwise need to be done when updating forward and backward links on an insertion."
632274,easy,Which data structure uses less space per object?,an array,a linked list,they are both the same,,"In a linked list, you create a Node for each element that contains not only the element but a link to the next Node. In addition, you create a List object that contains additional fields such as a link to the first Node in the list and (often) the size of the list. In an array, you store only the elements, not a Node or a link to the next Node. "
633310,medium,What abstract data type is best suited to help us implement a breadth-first search?,queue,priority queue,stack,hashtable,"In a breadth-first search, we visit the starting element, its neighbors, its neighbors' neighbors, and so on. We want to make sure we visit the neighbors of the elements we saw earliest before we visit the neighbors of elements we saw later. This suggests a first-in, first out approach."

Bytes range from -128 to 127."
634431,easy,Which data structure must be traversed one element at a time to reach a particular point?,,a linked list,an array,both,"In a basic linked list, each element is connected to the one after it. To reach a given element, you must start with the first node, if it's not the one you want, follow the link to the next one, and so forth until you reach the end of the list."
632575,easy,What is the correct formula for the load factor?,m/s,s + m,s - m,m - s,"The load factor is the number of elements (m) in the array, divided by the size (s) of the array. It gives you an idea of how full the hashtable is."

They cannot be resized."
634951,hard,"What is the simplest data structure if you don't know exactly how much data you need to store, but there's not much of it?",Linked list,Unordered array,Ordered array,Hashtable,"Since arrays must be allocated before they are used, we tend to overallocate to make sure we have sufficient capacity. This wastes space. If we're not exactly sure of how much storage we need and without a need for fast searching, a linked list is a good choice."
633576,hard,Which algorithm do you avoid if you  have no extra memory to spare?,merge sort,bubble sort,quick sort,heap sort,Merge sort requires a secondary array to merge into. Don'to use it if you  have don't extra memory to spare.

635040,easy,What is the lifetime of a parameter in Java?,From when its method is called until it returns,Really long,From when you define the method until you quit out of Eclipse,As long as the program is running,"The lifetime of a variable is the duration over which it keeps a value unless you change it.   With a parameter, its value is set when you invoke the method, and it retains that value (or what every you subsequently set it to) until you return."
634926,easy,In which cases inheritance polymorphism is preferable among interface polymorphism?,The classes are closely related in the inheritance hierarchy,There is no defined interface that works for all of the classes that I want to allow,The classes are in the same containment hierarchy,It is the kind of polymorphism that I understand the best,"Polymorphism is used when different classes we are modeling can do the same thing (i.e. respond to the same method calls), and we don't know which class an object will be at compile time. In Java, this can be implemented using either inheritance or interfaces. If the classes are closely related in the inheritance hierarchy it should be possible to have the shared methods in some common superclass, which is close."
634985,easy,What kind of parameter passing is used in C++?,call by value and call by reference,call by name,call by reference,call by value,"C++ defaults to call by value, but allows for special sytax to force call by reference."
634988,easy,What kind of parameter passing is used in Java?,call by value,call by reference,call by name,call by value-return,"Java uses call by value.  If the given parameter is an object, which is really a reference, then under call by value, the formal parameter is really just an alias (additional reference) to the actual parameter object."
630968,easy,"In Java, what word is used to refer to the current object, or to call one constructor from another in the same class?",this,constructor,new,null,"In Java, the reserved word this is used within a method or constructor to refer to the current object, or in the first statement of a constructor to call a different constructor in the same class."
630989,easy,"For any JUnit test class, when is the setUp() method executed?",Each time before a test method is executed,Only when explicitly invoked,Once before all the test methods are executed,Only after the test class constructor method is executed,"In a JUnit, the setUp() method is used to set up the same starting conditions for all test methods in a test class.  It is automatically executed before each test method, for every test method in the class."
630661,easy,What effect does the statement Option Explicit in the declaration section have on a Visual Basic module?,All variables in the module have to be declared before use,The programmer is given the option to save code before the program is run,Global variables may be declared in the declarations section,Procedures in the module may be accessed from other modules in the project,"In Visual Basic, when Option Explicit appears in a file, you must explicitly declare all variables using the Dim or ReDim statements. If you attempt to use an undeclared variable name, an error occurs at compile time. Use Option Explicit to avoid incorrectly typing the name of an existing variable or to avoid confusion in code where the scope of the variable is not clear. If you do not use the Option Explicit statement, all undeclared variables are of Object type."
625176,easy,"What is the maximum result of computing X % 7, where all we know about X is that it is a positive integer?",6,0,1,7,"% is the modular division operation, which perform division and returns the remainder.  For example, 7 % 7 is 0, since 7 goes into 7 once with a remainder of 0.  8 % 7 is 1, since 7 goes into 8 with a remainder of 1.  Similarly, 13 % 7 is 6, while 14 % 7 is again 0, since 7 goes into 14 twice with no remainder.  If you mod a positive integer by N, the maximum result is N-1."
633272,easy,"After the assignment signal = 'abracadabra',  what is returned by signal[:5]?",abrac,abraca,c,error,"Slices in Python work with both lists and with Strings, and go up to but not including the limit.  For instace, if  the limit is 5, we get the first 5 characters (indexed 0 through 4). After the assignment signal = 'abracadabra',  signal[:5] returns 'abrac'. "
633275,easy,"After the assignment signal = 'abracadabra', what is returned by signal[-1:]?",a,abracadabra,error,,"Python actually allows negative indexes, which start counting from the back of a list or String.  However, the slice operation by default still only uses increasing indexes.  So, for a string signal = 'abracadabra', signal [-1:] means to slice from the last character through the rest of the String , returning 'a' (slice operations that leave out the upper boundary implicitly mean ""slice to the end"")."
633224,easy,"In Java, what does it mean if something is marked static?",It exists outside of any particular instance of the class.,It never changes value.,It cannot be overridden.,Its value is undetermined.,"In Java, something that is static is defined at the class level and is accessed through the class, rather than through an instance."
633575,easy,In the expression n = null in code that successfully compiles. Which is not a legal type of n?,boolean,Integer,String,Object,"Boolean's can only be true or false. If variable n is a boolean, the expression n = null will not compile."
